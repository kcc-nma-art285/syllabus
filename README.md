## Course Objectives & Competencies
Upon successful completion of ART 285, the student should be able to:
- Through the creation of a large-scale new media art project, apply advanced concepts and
principles of graphic design and user interface design technologies.
- Develop conceptual project ideas, plan a full production schedule, and execute all iterative
steps and phases of the full design process by meeting project milestones and deadlines.
- Apply theoretical and historically relevant principles of graphic design and user interface design
in the creation of new media art.
- Apply successful problem-solving skills and make informed design decisions while utilizing
industry standard applications, technologies, and techniques throughout the full creative
and technical design process.
- Communicate effectively, both visually and verbally, by presenting work, defending design
decisions and by participating as an active critic during group critiques.
- Synthesize the concepts, principles, skills, and techniques of user interface design in the creation
of a large-scale project that integrates conceptual thinking, technical execution, and
aesthetic application.

## Course Content
The general framework for this course consists of a four stage process based on the user-centered design methodologies: Discovery, Design, Development, Delivery.

1. **Discovery**
  - Defining the project
    - Estimating the work
  - User & business research
  - Design strategy (ideation/prototyping)
2. **Design**
  - Conceptualizing, creating and refining assets for the project
3. **Development**
  - Coding/programming, editing, & revising
4. **Delivery**
  - Testing across various display formats/media
  - Presenting completed project to client

## Topics addressed and content
Topics and Technologies will vary depending upon each student’s chosen project. Individual topics
and techniques may include: defining goals, profiles, and users, copy writing, creative writing,
defining features and functionality, concept drawings, storyboards, wireframes, site maps,
prototypes, mood boards, type & color studies, creation of graphical elements, illustration,
branding, graphic symbolism, design mockups, interface programming, motion graphic design;
sound design, testing, printing, and quality assurance.

Universal course content:
- Exploration and application of contemporary topics in user interface design and new media art based on need and purpose.
- Overview of the full design process for interface design via theory and practice of historical
and contemporary issues in interface design and new media art.
- Theory and application of researching and conceptual planning for large-scale works of
interface design and new media art.
- Theory and application of the iterative visual design mockup/comp process for large-scale
works of interface design and new media art.
- Theory and application of utilizing various technical production processes including small
scale tests, experiments, and explorations of various technologies and techniques for large-
scale works of interface design and new media art.
- Development and preparation of iterative presentations that demonstrate meeting project
milestones, overall goals, and the needs of the client/user.
- Use of the appropriate industry standard design applications and software.
- Quality Assurance Testing: problem-solving and troubleshooting appropriate technologies.
- Overview of best practices for client presentations, including the importance of using an
expanded design vocabulary, highlighting the importance of good design practices,
speaking articulately, defending design decisions, taking criticism well, and participating as
an active critic of self and others during group critiques.
- Final Presentation of a culminating large-scale project that synthesizes the concepts and
principles of interface design and new media art by displaying work that is complete,
robust, tested, and ready for launch/use.

## Texts
There are no required texts for this course. Readings will be supplied by the instructor on a week-
to-week basis, in either paper handout form or online.

Recommended, but not required texts:
- [About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118766571.html) by Alan Cooper
- [Design is a Job](http://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) by Mike Montiero

## Materials
All students are required to have hosting space to post their assignments, internship
documentation, and ultimately their final presentation. Students can purchase a
hosting plan with a third party hosting provider or utilize Git & GitHub for free static site hosting (GitHub does not include domain name services). 

Past students have purchased hosting plans from hosting providers such as Bluehost and GoDaddy (these are just a few of many hosting providers available). Plans should include ample disk space (ie. more than 2GB or unlimited), support for CGI, PHP, and MySQL, multiple domain hosting (to host more than one site), one-click install/support for popular CMS options (Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, etc), and a low, competitive price (an example rate is around $3-$5/month – this is subject to change based upon current trends for hosting prices).

Additional materials may include an external hard drive or thumbnail drive with a minimum
capacity of 4 GB.

## Instructor's Expectation
Attendance and online class participation are important to succeed in this course. It is essential
that you attend both face-to-face class meetings, arrive promptly, and remain for the full duration
of the scheduled class periods. Time outside of class and at your internship location is required in
order to meet the requirements of the class. All assignments are due by posting them online by the
specified due date/time as specified on course schedule.

Please use the Laulima’s online discussion feature for general questions that may benefit others or
that others can answer (instead of email), and Laulima’s private messages feature, as necessary.

## Method of Instruction
The method of instruction will include individual feedback/instruction, lectures, demonstrations,
class discussions, and critiques.

## Method of Evaluation & Grading Policy
The methods of evaluation used in this course are broken down as follows:

- **Projects & Assignments**: 80%
- **Class Participation**: 20%
- **Total**: 100%

Students will be expected to participate as active class members. This includes attending all
classes; meeting all project deadlines; completing production time outside of class and in the lab
environment; and participating as dependable team members. During critiques, all students are
required to participate as both presenters and critics.

Grading is based on projects and class participation during critiques and online. It is the
responsibility of the student to take notes, plan accordingly, and turn in completed assignments on
the due dates. Missing a deadline will result in a point reduction equivalent to a full letter grade,
unless there is a valid medical reason or a family emergency. Class Participation is calculated
based upon a student’s participation during critiques and online via Laulima in the discussion
area. Projects may be revised and turned in again for re-grading.

Five major components of the class are worth 100 points each, with a total of 500 points for the
course grade. The 500 Points for the final course grade can be broken down as follows:

### 500 Point Course Grading System

All Grades are available throughout the semester via Laulima

**Discovery**
- Proposal & Estimate: 50 Points
- Strategy & Concept Prototypes: 50 Points
- Total: 100 Points

**Design**

**TOTAL: 500 Points**

Dividing the total 500 points by 5 will yield a more legible final course letter grade, dictated as
follows:
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: 59-0

## Student Conduct Code
A college campus is a community with specific behavior expectations designed to allow all
students, faculty, and staff to flourish. Please familiarize yourself with KCC’s Student Conduct
Code in the course catalog. You should know your rights and responsibilities on campus. The
Student Conduct Code describes specific campus policies related to: drug and alcohol use,
smoking, lethal weapons, sexual harassment and sexual assault, academic honesty,
nondiscrimination, and family privacy.

In all campus environments, Disruptive Behavior will not be tolerated. This means: any speech or
action that (1) is disrespectful, offensive, and/or threatening; (2) interferes with the learning
activities of other students; (3) impedes the delivery of college services; and/or (4) has a negative
impact in any learning environment.

## This Class is a “Safe Zone”
Discriminatory or rude comments of any kind, particularly regarding gender, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, or religion, will not be tolerated.
